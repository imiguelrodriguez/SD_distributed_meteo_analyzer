# SD_distributed_meteo_analyzer
Task 1 of SD (Sistemes Distribu√Øts) subject. The system analyzes fictional meteorogical data and communicates with servers which process and store the data. It explores both direct and indirect communication. The results will be shown as a real-time plot in a terminal. 

The system has been developed using the PyCharm IDE and a virtual environment. The required installed modules are: `grpcio`, `pika`, `pickle`, `json`, `redis`, `pytz` and `matplotlib`. The rest of the modules are supposed to be installed by default.

Please, make sure that a **Redis** server is running on default port 6379, and a **RabbitMQ** server is running on default port 5672.
## Direct communication
In order to run the direct communication system, follow the next steps:
1. Run `loadBalancer.py` in the **lb** folder.
2. Run several `airSensor.py` and `pollutionSensor.py` in the **sensors** folder.
3. Run several `processingServer.py` in the **ps** folder.
4. Run `proxy.py` in the **proxy** folder.
5. Run several `model.py` inside the **terminal/model** folder.

## Indirect communication
In order to run the indirect communication system, follow the next steps:
1. Run several `airSensorIndirect.py` and `pollutionSensorIndirect.py` in the **sensors** folder.
2. Run several `processingServerIndirect.py` in the **ps** folder.
3. Run `proxyIndirect.py` in the **proxy** folder.
4. Run several `modelIndirect.py` inside the **terminal/model** folder.
